Notes:

	When iterating through pandas dataframe, rather than appending new row when creating new dataframe
	rather append to list or dict, for performance

	if data is too large, will have to make functionality to read in batches

	user must specify column names as price, volume...

	time bars: inclusive on left side  of bar, exclusive on right i.e. trades are included on "[t0, t1)" basis
	
	put make_bars in init?

	pd.read_csv necessary to specify index column which also must be dates, names of column (price, volume)

	datetime index must have same precision
